I made this project by referring to Nicholas Renotte's series on Siamese Neural Networks which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgNJO2hghbmhHuhURAGbe6KWpiYZt0AMH) \
It is based on a research paper which you can find [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf)\

I've changed many things in the code from the playlist to make the model more accurate and efficient, but the overall methodology remains the same.
